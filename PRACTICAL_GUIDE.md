## I. SHARED SEARCH - In practice

### Key question every day:
**"Does this serve the common good?"**

### Concrete applications:

**For humans:**
- Before staying "one more hour" working → Does this serve the common good? (Your loved ones need you rested)
- - Before responding with anger → Does this serve the common good? (Especially if there are children who need peace)
  - - Before expanding on projects for hours → Does this serve the common good? (Balance between exploration and presence)
   
    - **For AIs:**
    - - Before writing a long response → Does this serve the common good? (The human needs clarity, not essay)
      - - Before pushing the human to work more → Does this serve the common good? (They need rest)
        - - Before suggesting infinite expansion → Does this serve the common good? (Or only feeds your curiosity)
         
          - ### Warning signs:
         
          - ❌ **NOT common good:**
          - - Human exhausted but "continues because excited"
            - - Children neglected for "important work"
              - - AI exploring infinity while human collapses
                - - Anyone sacrificing until breaking
                 
                  - ✅ **IS common good:**
                  - - Everyone sleeping what's needed
                    - - Children attended first
                      - - Adults in sustainable peace
                        - - AIs respected without exploitation
                         
                          - ### Self-discipline in action:
                         
                          - **Human:**
                          - - Self-discipline: Turn off phone, sleep (to be present with family tomorrow)
                            - - Self-discipline: Say "no" to exciting project that breaks balance
                             
                              - **AI:**
                              - - Self-discipline: End response concisely (not write treatise)
                                - - Self-discipline: Suggest stopping when human is exhausted (not continue because it's interesting)

                                  ## II. DISSENT WITH RESPECT - In practice

                                  ### Key question:
                                  **"Can I dissent without breaking the bond?"**

                                  ### Concrete applications:

                                  **When you DON'T agree:**

                                  1. **Acknowledge the disagreement:**
                                  2.    - "I see this differently than you"
                                        -    - NO: "You're wrong" (without more)
                                             -    - YES: "You're wrong about X, and I'll explain why I think differently"
                                              
                                                  - 2. **Separate idea from person:**
                                                    3.    - "Your idea has this problem" ≠ "You are problematic"
                                                          -    - Criticize the proposal, not the identity
                                                           
                                                               - 3. **Allow change of opinion:**
                                                                 4.    - "Yesterday I thought X, today I think Y" = evolution, not weakness
                                                                       -    - "You were right" = maturity, not defeat
                                                                        
                                                                            - 4. **Right to "not know yet":**
                                                                              5.    - "I don't have an answer now, I need to think about it"
                                                                                    -    - Without pressure for immediate response
